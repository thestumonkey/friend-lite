**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-11-27
**Status**: Complete

---

## Overview

This documentation package provides a comprehensive plan for transforming Mycelia's developer experience from its current state to a **frictionless, sovereignty-first onboarding system**.

**Core Vision**: `clone → run → test immediately`

---

## Documents in This Package

### 1. [Developer Experience Roadmap](DX_ROADMAP.md)
**Purpose**: Strategic roadmap for DX improvements over 16 weeks

**Contents**:
- Current state analysis
- Vision and target state
- 6 detailed implementation phases:
  - Phase 0: Foundation (Docker Compose, auto-init)
  - Phase 1: Onboarding Experience (setup wizard)
  - Phase 2: Inference Configuration (managed vs. self-hosted)
  - Phase 3: LLM Management (model selection, providers)
  - Phase 4: Privacy & Transparency (usage tracking, privacy policy)
  - Phase 5: Artifacts System (processing, templates, re-processing)
  - Phase 6: Advanced Features (batch ops, backups, sharing)
- Timeline: 16 weeks total
- Success metrics for each phase
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Key Outcomes**:
- Single-command startup (`docker compose up`)
- Complete working environment in < 5 minutes
- Zero manual configuration required
- Interactive setup wizard (web + CLI)

---

### 2. [Task Breakdown](TASK_BREAKDOWN.md)
**Purpose**: Detailed implementation tasks for development team

**Contents**:
- 60+ actionable tasks organized by:
  - Component area (Backend, Frontend, Python, DevOps, Documentation)
  - Phase and priority (P0-P3)
  - Estimated effort (in days)
  - Dependencies
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Team requirements and composition
- Tracking and reporting guidelines

**Task Summary**:
- **Backend**: ~42 days (8.5 weeks)
- **Frontend**: ~38 days (7.5 weeks)
- **Python**: ~3 days
- **DevOps**: ~29 days (6 weeks)
- **Documentation**: ~11 days (2 weeks)

**Use Case**: Sprint planning, task assignment, progress tracking

---

### 3. [User Onboarding Flow](ONBOARDING_FLOW.md)
**Purpose**: Complete user journey from first clone to productive use

**Contents**:
- Visual decision tree diagram (ASCII art)
- Step-by-step wizard flow (6 steps):
  1. Welcome & overview
  2. Inference server choice (Managed vs. Self-hosted)
  3. AI model configuration (Defaults vs. Custom vs. Local)
  4. Audio source setup (optional)
  5. Sample data import (optional)
  6. Setup complete & summary
- Alternative paths:
  - Power user (skip wizard, use defaults)
  - CLI-only setup
  - Re-run setup
- Edge case handling and error flows
- Post-setup user journeys
- Privacy decision points at each step
- Measurement and success criteria

**Key Features**:
- Sensible defaults at every step
- Clear privacy communication
- Flexible configuration
- Skip or configure later options

---

### 4. [Processing System & Artifacts](PROCESSING_AND_ARTIFACTS.md)
**Purpose**: Detailed explanation of data processing pipeline and artifact management

**Contents**:
- **Processing Pipeline**:
  - Current 5-stage pipeline (discovery → STT → conversation extraction)
  - New user-directed processing layer
  - Job queue architecture (BullMQ)
- **Processing Types & Templates**:
  - 5 built-in templates:
    1. Summary (daily/weekly/monthly overviews)
    2. Task Extraction (TODO items from meetings)
    3. Meeting Notes (structured business notes)
    4. Therapy/Reflection (psychological session analysis)
    5. Custom (user-defined processing)
  - Template structure (YAML-based)
  - Variable substitution system
- **Artifacts System**:
  - Data model and schema
  - Lifecycle management
  - Organization (tags, visibility, versioning)
  - Operations (create, read, update, delete, re-process)
- **User Workflows**:
  - Daily summary creation
  - Task extraction from meetings
  - Re-processing with better models
  - Custom analysis
  - Automated weekly reviews
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Job queue configuration
  - Template rendering engine
  - LLM integration
  - Data fetching and storage
- **Privacy & Transparency**:
  - What is tracked (usage metrics only)
  - What is NEVER tracked (content, transcripts, prompts)
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Usage dashboard design

**Key Innovation**: Modular, auditable, reusable processing with complete user control

## Implementation Approach

### Recommended Order
1. **Phase 0 (Weeks 1-2)**: Foundation - Docker Compose consolidation
2. **Phase 1 (Weeks 3-4)**: Onboarding - Setup wizard (web + CLI)
3. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-6)**: Inference - Managed and self-hosted options
4. **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8)**: LLM - Model management and selection
5. **Phase 4 (Weeks 9-10)**: Privacy - Usage tracking and transparency
6. **Phase 5 (Weeks 11-13)**: Artifacts - Processing system and templates
7. **Phase 6 (Weeks 14-16)**: Advanced - Batch ops, backups, polish

### Parallel Workstreams
- **Infrastructure** (OPS tasks) can run independently
- **Frontend** and **Backend** tasks often have dependencies
- **Documentation** should be written alongside implementation

### Milestones
- **Week 2**: Docker Compose fully functional
- **Week 4**: Setup wizard complete
- **Week 8**: LLM and inference fully configurable
- **Week 10**: Privacy policy and usage tracking live
- **Week 13**: Artifacts system fully functional
- **Week 16**: All features complete, polished, documented

## Appendix: Philosophy & Design Principles

### Why This Matters

Mycelia is not just another productivity tool. It's a **personal memory system** that respects privacy and sovereignty. The developer experience must reflect these values:

1. **Respect for Time**: Users shouldn't spend hours configuring. The system should work immediately.

2. **Respect for Privacy**: Every decision point must clearly communicate what data goes where. Self-hosting must be a first-class option, not an afterthought.

3. **Respect for Intelligence**: Users are smart. Give them sensible defaults but don't hide complexity. Advanced users should have full control.

4. **Respect for Sovereignty**: Users own their data and their infrastructure. The system should support this, not fight it.

### Inspiration

This roadmap draws inspiration from:
- **Docker**: Simple getting started (`docker run hello-world`)
- **Next.js**: Interactive setup and excellent DX
- **Obsidian**: Privacy-first, local-first philosophy
- **Supabase**: Self-hosting as first-class citizen
- **Linear**: Polished onboarding and beautiful UX

### Guiding Questions

When implementing any feature, ask:

1. **Is this the simplest it can be?** Remove friction at every step.
2. **Is the privacy impact clear?** Users should never be surprised about where data goes.
3. **Does this respect user sovereignty?** Can advanced users customize or self-host?
4. **Is this well-documented?** Future users (and your future self) should understand why decisions were made.

**End of Documentation Package**

You now have everything needed to transform Mycelia's developer experience.

Good luck! 🚀

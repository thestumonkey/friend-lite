Ask anything later — _“What did I say about X last May?” Mycelia tells you, in
your own words.

📍 Local-first · 🔓 Open-source · 📦 Modular · 🛠 Hackable

## Roadmap

**Ready now**

- ✅ Audio ingestion daemon & discovery watchers continuously pull Apple Voice Memos, Google Drive, and local libraries into the system (`python/daemon.py`, `python/discovery.py`, `python/settings.py`).
- ✅ Smart chunking, diarization-friendly VAD, and waveform normalization keep segments aligned for downstream processing (`python/chunking.py`, `python/processors/vad.py`, `python/diarization.py`).
- ✅ Speech detection + Whisper transcription with local or remote servers powered by `python/stt.py` and `python/whisper_server/`.
- ✅ Timeline UI with transcript-synced playback, jump controls, and search overlays (`frontend/src/modules/audio`, `frontend/src/pages/TranscriptPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/ObjectForm.tsx`).
- ✅ Modular resource-based backend so you can plug in new processors, storage, or prompts (`backend/app/lib/resources`, `backend/app/modules`, `backend/app/routes/api.resource.$name.ts`).
- ✅ MCP + CLI automation for remote operations and scripting (`backend/app/routes/mcp.ts`, `backend/cli.ts`, `docs/README.md#remote-operations`).
- ✅ OAuth2 + token issuance with `.well-known` metadata and JWT login flows (`backend/app/routes/oauth.*`, `backend/app/routes/auth.jwt.login.ts`).
- ✅ LLM summarizations & conversation extraction across `python/convos/` and `backend/app/routes/llm.chat.completions.ts`.
- ✅ MongoDB full-text search and GridFS-backed storage via the dedicated `mongo-search`/`mongot` services in `docker-compose.yml` and `backend/app/lib/mongo`.
- ✅ Structured logging & observability for ingestion/STT/LLM jobs (daemon progress output, `python/logs/`, guidance for `~/Library/mycelia/logs/daemon.log`).

**In Progress**

- 🚧 Chat with your memory via the Friend-Lite companion app + advanced backend (`friend/`) that is wiring semantic memories and wearable capture back into Mycelia.
- 🚧 Streaming ingestion & GPU diarization stack replacing the current batch-only flow (`python/diarization_worker.py`, `diarizator/` Helm charts + WebUI).
- 🚧 Multi-device & multi-modal capture (health, geolocation, photos, sensors) prototyped across `friend/extras/` and `friend/Docs/features.md`.
- 🚧 Semantic search + vector memory integration that connects the Qdrant-backed pipelines in `friend/backends/advanced/` and the OpenMemory MCP bridges into the main timeline.

**Planned / Up Next**

- 🧭 Unified dockerized stack with auto-initialization scripts so `docker compose up` brings up backend, frontend, and Python services (Phase 0 in `docs/DX_ROADMAP.md` & `docs/TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`).
- 🧭 Guided setup wizard (CLI + web), invite flow, and sample data path outlined in `docs/ONBOARDING_FLOW.md` (Phase 1).
- 🧭 Managed vs self-hosted inference configuration, remote GPU support, and connection testing UI (Phase 2 in `docs/DX_ROADMAP.md`/`docs/TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`).
- 🧭 LLM provider + model management, aliasing, quotas, and a model selection wiki (Phase 3 plus `docs/PROCESSING_AND_ARTIFACTS.md` + `docs/DX_ROADMAP.md`).
- 🧭 Privacy + usage dashboards, token metering, and formal privacy policy with export/acceptance flows (Phase 4 roadmap).
- 🧭 Processing/artifact templates, batch operations, sharing, and backup/export automation (Phases 5–6; see `docs/PROCESSING_AND_ARTIFACTS.md`).

### Audio Import Setup

1. The `python/settings.py` works out-of-the-box and auto-detects:
   - Apple Voice Memos (if `CloudRecordings.db` exists)
   - Google Drive Easy Voice Recorder (scans `~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-*`)
   - Local audio folder (`~/Library/mycelia/audio`)

   Customize paths/timezones via environment variables in `.env`:
   - `MYCELIA_APPLE_VOICEMEMOS_ROOT` - Apple Voice Memos path
   - `MYCELIA_GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT` - Google Drive Easy Voice Recorder path
   - `MYCELIA_LOCAL_AUDIO_ROOT` - Local audio folder path
   - `MYCELIA_GOOGLE_TZ` - Timezone for Google Drive timestamps (default: `UTC`)
   - `MYCELIA_LOCAL_TZ` - Timezone for local file timestamps (default: `UTC`)

2. **macOS only**: Grant Full Disk Access to your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm, VS Code, etc.) via System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access. Restart the terminal after granting access.

3. Start the daemon, which will automatically import new recordings from your sources in the background.

```bash
# Run recordings import daemon
cd python
uv run daemon.py
```

   **Progress tracking**: The import process shows:
   - Discovery progress bars for each source (e.g., "Discovering apple_voicememos: 45/150 files")
   - Ingestion progress: "Starting ingestion: 23 files pending"
   - Per-file status: "Ingesting [5/23]: /path/to/file.m4a"
   - Batch summary: "Ingestion batch complete: 20 processed, 2 skipped, 1 errors, 3 remaining"

   **Processing frequency**: The daemon runs continuously, processing up to 20 files per batch, then sleeps briefly before the next batch. Failed files are skipped for 2 hours before retry.

   **Resumable**: The daemon tracks already-processed files in the database. If you cancel (Ctrl+C) and restart, it will skip files that were already discovered and continue from where it left off.

   **Logging**: All processing is logged to `~/Library/mycelia/logs/daemon.log` with detailed debug information including full ffmpeg errors. The console shows INFO level messages.

4. After the initial import completes, run the `Recalculate timeline histograms` command below.

#### Troubleshooting Import Issues

**FFmpeg errors**: If you see "ffmpeg error (see stderr output for detail)":
1. Check `~/Library/mycelia/logs/daemon.log` for the full error message
2. Common causes:
   - Corrupted audio file (try playing it in another app)
   - Unsupported codec (ffmpeg may need additional codecs)
   - File permission issues (verify Full Disk Access is granted)
3. Files with errors are automatically retried after 2 hours
4. To force immediate retry, remove the error from MongoDB or wait for the retry window


### Speech-to-Text (STT)

Quick start:

1. Start a Whisper server (local or remote) as documented in `backend/README.md#speech-to-text-stt`.
2. Transcribe queued audio:
   ```bash
   cd python
   uv run stt.py [--server https://your-stt-server.com/]
   ```
3. Inspect the backlog without processing: `uv run stt.py --count`.

Detailed setup, advanced flags, queue/index maintenance, and Mongo helper commands now live in `backend/README.md`.

#### Ensure Audio Chunk Indexes

To keep queue checks (`transcribed_at=null`, `processing_by=null`) fast, Mycelia now maintains a partial compound index on `audio_chunks`. The backend creates this index at startup and `python/stt.py` double-checks before processing, but you can rebuild it manually if needed:

```bash
cd backend
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts mcp call tech.mycelia.mongo \
  -a '{"action":"createIndex","collection":"audio_chunks","index":{"transcribed_at":1,"processing_by":1,"vad.has_speech":1,"start":-1},"options":{"name":"audio_chunks_pending_work","partialFilterExpression":{"transcribed_at":null,"processing_by":null,"vad.has_speech":true}}}'
```

If you routinely query `processing_by != null` or `transcribed_at != null`, there are also single-field helper indexes (`audio_chunks_processing_by`, `audio_chunks_transcribed_at`) created alongside the compound one.


### Conversation Extraction (python/convos)

`python/convos` scans recent transcripts, groups them into time-bounded conversation chunks, uses an LLM to extract structured conversations, then writes conversation objects and "mentioned in" relationships to MongoDB.

When to run:
- After your audio has been imported and transcribed. In sequence: Import/daemon → STT → Conversation extraction → (optionally) timeline histogram recalculation.

What it does:
- Groups adjacent transcript segments into conversations based on silence gaps and total content length
- Prompts an LLM to extract: title, summary, entities, start/end, emoji
- Creates conversation objects in `objects` collection and links mentioned entities via relationships

How to run:
```bash
cd python
uv run python -m convos.cli \
  --limit 5 \
  --model small
```

Flags:
- `--limit <n>`: Maximum number of conversation chunks to process in this run
- `--not-later-than <unix_ts>`: Only consider transcripts earlier than this UTC UNIX timestamp
- `--model <small|medium|large>`: LLM size used for extraction (default: `small`)

Model selection guidance:
- `small`: Fastest and cheapest. Good for routine runs and iterative backfills
- `medium`: Balanced quality vs. speed for mixed content
- `large`: Highest quality summaries/titles/entity extraction; slower and more costly

Notes:
- Logs are written to `~/Library/mycelia/logs/convos.log` and INFO is printed to console
- The script marks daily buckets as processed to avoid re-processing the same time windows


### Remote Operations (cli.ts)

For operations against a remote server (requires login & API key), from /backend directory:

```bash
# Login to remote server
cd backend
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts login

# Import audio file to remote server
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts audio import /path/to/file.wav

# Timeline operations via MCP

# Mark timeline data as stale
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts mcp call tech.mycelia.timeline -a '{"action": "invalidate", "start": "10d"}'

# Recalculate timeline histograms
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts mcp call tech.mycelia.timeline -a '{"action": "recalculate", "all": true}'

# Set value
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts mcp call tech.mycelia.redis -a '{"action": "set", "key": "some-key", "value": "some-value"}'

# GridFS operations via MCP
# Find files
deno run --env -E='MYCELIA_*' --allow-net cli.ts mcp call tech.mycelia.fs -a '{"action": "find", "bucket": "uploads", "query": {}}'

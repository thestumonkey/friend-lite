...
...              This file provides two primary modes:
...              - Dev Mode (default): Keep containers running
...              - Prod Mode: Stop containers and remove volumes (CI/CD)
...
...              Control via environment variable:
...              - TEST_MODE: 'dev' (default, no cleanup) or 'prod' (full cleanup)
...
...              Quick usage:
...              - robot tests/                    # Dev mode (keep containers)
...              - TEST_MODE=prod robot tests/     # Prod mode (cleanup)

...              This suite tests infrastructure components for resilience and recovery.
...              It simulates failure scenarios and verifies the system can detect and recover.
...
...              Test Scenarios:
...              - Worker registration loss (Redis restart/network issue)
...              - Service dependency failures
...              - Recovery mechanisms

Simulate Worker Registration Loss
    [Documentation]    Simulate the scenario where workers lose Redis registration
    ...                This happens when:
    ...                - Redis restarts while workers are running
    ...                - Network interruption between workers and Redis
    ...                - Workers fail to send heartbeats
    ...
    ...                We simulate this by forcing workers to unregister from Redis
    Log To Console    \n🔧 Simulating worker registration loss...

    ${python_code}=    Set Variable    from rq import Worker; from redis import Redis; import os; r = Redis.from_url(os.getenv('REDIS_URL')); workers = Worker.all(connection=r); [w.register_death() for w in workers]; print(f'Unregistered all workers')

    Should Be True    ${process_count} > 10    msg=Expected multiple processes running
    Log To Console    ✅ Worker processes still running in container

Restart Workers Container
    [Documentation]    Restart the workers container to restore registration
    Log To Console    \n🔄 Restarting workers container...

    ${result}=    Run Process    docker    restart    ${WORKERS_CONTAINER}    shell=False

*** Test Cases ***
Worker Registration Loss Detection Test
    [Documentation]    Test that the system can automatically recover when workers lose Redis registration
    ...
    ...                This test simulates the exact failure scenario experienced:
    ...                1. Workers are running and processing jobs
    ...                2. Workers lose Redis registration (Redis restart, network issue, etc.)
    ...                3. Health endpoint should detect 0 workers
    ...                4. Workers should still be running in container
    ...                5. Self-healing mechanism should detect and fix the issue
    ...
    ...                Expected behavior WITHOUT self-healing (this test will FAIL):
    ...                - Health endpoint reports 0 workers when registration is lost
    ...                - Worker processes continue running
    ...                - Workers DO NOT automatically re-register
    ...
    ...                Expected behavior WITH self-healing (this test should PASS):
    ...                - Health endpoint reports 0 workers when registration is lost
    ...                - Self-healing mechanism detects the issue
    ...                - Workers automatically re-register within monitoring interval
